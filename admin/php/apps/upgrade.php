			<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			<ul class="faq">
				<li>
					<p class="question">What if I'm not satisfied with the purchase?</p>
					<p>If you're not 100% satisfied with WP Marketing within 15 days of purchase, we'll immediately refund you (and cancel future payments).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="question">Do you offer a free trial?</p>
					<p>If you're really not sure about whether WP Marketing is for you, send us an email at dallas@excitecreative.ca and we'll set you up with a couple free days of service. We're also working on video tutorials that will show you the power of WP Marketing.</p>
				</li>

					<p class="question">Do I have to sign a long-term contract?</p>
					<p>No. WP Marketing is a pay-as-you-go service. There are no long-term contracts or commitments on your part. If you purchase our annual subscription, then you simply pay year-to-year. When you cancel your subscription, you will lose the access to themes and wonâ€™t be billed again.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="question">Do you have one-time or multi-year purchasing options?</p>
					<p>Not at the moment.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="question">How often do you add new apps?</p>
					<p>Our app releases aren't on a rigid schedule - we want to make sure they're incredibly useful, easy-to-use, and bug-free. They could range from a week to a month.</p>
